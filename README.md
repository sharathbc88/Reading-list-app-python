    I used Kivy Demos mainly and taxi lab exercise, code academy for user defined functions, learnpython.org
    and jeffknupp.com for understanding classes and inheretence

## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.
     Main hardship was to differentiate between methods and classes, jeffknupp.com helped me understand that classes
     are made up of special methods and user defined methods and to use methods of different class object i need to
     inherit or call the class with a varaible and then use the methods with a dot notation.
     My teachers helped me understanding on storing objects into a class and calling them
